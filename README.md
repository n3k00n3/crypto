This is a simple study about Cryptography and ciphers using C and Assembly languages.

This repo was created only to practice C and ASM language, this way i can use my interest about cryptology to improve my skills.

If you find some mistakes, please, send me a Pull Request. You can use my codes too, they are free as freedom.
